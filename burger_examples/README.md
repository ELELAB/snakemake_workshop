# Burger preparation demonstrations

Each directory contains the examples that are used as demonstration during
the workshop. They are about create a "file hamburger" - note that each
ingredient is a file and the different steps simply create files. They
are meant to demonstrate the main features we will consider for Snakemake
rather than be a scientifically relevant example.
